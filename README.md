# Dbcalc

I saw a physics lecture on calculating the volume of sound at a given distance and thought it would be fun to whip up something to automate the process in Python. I spot checked the values this program gives off with a REED R8080 that has been calibrated to ensure they are approximately accurate to real world measurements.

For now see source code comments for usage instructions.

# Limits

The minimum output this program can give is -25 dbA or its equivalent intensity in w/m^2, well past the threshold of human hearing. For scientific purposes where you might need more range I recommend you use something besides my weekend project.
