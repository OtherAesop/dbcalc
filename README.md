# Dbcalc

I saw a physics lecture on calculating the volume of sound at a given distance and thought it would be fun to whip up something to automate the process in Python. I spot checked the values this program gives off with a REED R8080 that has been calibrated to ensure they are approximately accurate to real world measurements.

For now see source code comments for usage instructions.
